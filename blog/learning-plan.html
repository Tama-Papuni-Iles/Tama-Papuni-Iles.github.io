  <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong><br>I have always had a passion for computers both IT and graphic design.
     I believe that this course is a great opportunity for me to learn and grow and hope that one day I have enough knowledge to either build websites or technology for my Iwi and whanau. I do understand that there is a lot of 
    experience needed before I could venture off on my own but I do see myself in the long run returning home and helping out </p> 
  <p><strong>Strengths and Limitations - How They Relate to My Learning</strong> <br> I believe that my passion for my family and
     future in enough to push me through this course, I have rough times working hard jobs and I truly believe this is the 
     best opportunity for me. I can work well in teams or individually and I think that’s from growing up in a rural area where
      one day you're on a Marae with hundreds and the next everyone's gone and it's just you left doing all the mahi. <br>
     I have mentioned before that this is a major switch up for me, and keeping up with the criteria is taking a little longer than I had hoped. But my determination to succeed is far too high and the supports is there and 
     I so believe that is enough for me to get through this 15week bootcamp  </p>
     <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed
          in yourself while at EDA?</strong><br>Coming into the course I wasn’t too sure what it was I was looking forward to learning 
          the most, but after 2 weeks I now know that I have to develop skills in all areas of IT, both coding and navigating my way around a computer's functions.
           I would also like to improve my communication skills when it comes to working with others. I have worked in many different
           industries however this is very new and I will hope to make connections through-out this course  </p>
     <p><stron>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </stron> <br>
        I am definitely committed to this course. As I mentioned earlier this is a huge jump for me coming from truck driving to
         operating a pc, so 100% is definitely required on my end which I am doing. I've found html and css a little more difficult from 
         the first week and have spent a few late nights going over tutorials and workshops. I have good support on my end when it comes to 
         time management (my partner cooking dinners) and when things get a little too much, I have beautiful outdoor Gisborne where I could
          take a nice walk on the beach. I have always worked well in a team and think
         I have the communication skills to ensure every day and project is working as smooth as could it be. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help</strong> <br>
        Again, as I mentioned earlier, I am finding it rather hard. I have a lovely partner helping me at home, good group of people who
         are also studying with me at Taiki e that are more than helpful 
        and of course John my facilitator who has really helped in the last weeks. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong><br>
        John has been very helpful, especially in the first week when we were having troubles with GitBash. I expect him to be honest 
        about my work and help out as little as he can when it comes to solve problems, which he has been so far 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Other Commitments</strong> <br>
        When I first signed up for Dev Academy I was very aware of the dates and when we will complete the course, the main reason being October is also the due date 
        for me and my partners first child. I do understand there 
        is a bit of pressure being if baby comes early but I do think I have the support and full commitment to complete the course regardless. 
        Regardless of what the next 14 weeks has installed I do believe I will complete every task the reason being I have full faith that this course will benefit me in the future.
