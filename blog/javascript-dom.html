  <p><strong>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </strong><br>HTML and CSS both work together to
     produce data which is displayed on our page. The HTML will have the basics of the content and CSS will then style it. We 
     could think about it using a car as an example. HTML is like the shell of a car, which tells us we have 5 seats, 4 wheels,
     roof, doors, windows... This will give us basic instructions of where everything will be placed, how many we need and what their 
     purpose will be. It is the CSS which gives us more detail into how everything will look, exactly where it
      will be placed amongst other details 
    in the car, the size of each object, color and how they work with other components of the vehicle.   </p> 
  <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops. </strong> <br> Control flow is the flow in which your data executes code statements
     in your script, resulting in which code is used next, which is usually from top to bottom, line by line. However, there are ways
      that we can use and change the way codes are executed and picking out what and when we can use them. This is called a loop and we 
      use the loop when we need a code to be used continuously for a certain amount of time or until conditions have been established.
       We can think about it as a simple habit such as daily routines that often have changes but ending with the same result. If we 
       think about grocery shopping and how we would go about it with a groceries list. The list is from top to bottom, however we don’t
        have to follow the order of the list in order to get the job done efficiently. The list will still get executed but like the 
        code we can follow different formalities. </p>
     <p><strong>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </strong><br>The DOM also known as the Document
         Object Model, displays everything that is on your webpage. The webpage is made up of trees and all have one parent which is
          the window. We can then track down the tree to the Document where all the information about the page is stored, such as
           elements. It is here we can use Javascript to access these elements and make changes or add events. We can add click
           events or we can simply change a heading by calling an element and returning our information. We can do this by using
            the code    document.querySelector()  and selecting which element, class or id we want to make changes to.</p>
     <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </strong> <br>
        Arrays are a set list of information we can call by the number of which they are arranged, we use numbers to do so.
         The information is stalled within boxes - type.year = [“truck”, “Car”, “bus”, 16, 17, 18].  The list is called using
          ‘type.year’ or we can call a specific item from the list using the number in which they are stored in, the first object
           being zero. If we wanted to display the car, we would type out console.log(type.year[1]); This works well in some cases,
            however there are going to be moments we would like to access information using more simplified ways and not having to
             search the arrays list and count out what item to use. Objects work well with storing info and using it later in the code.
              An object is like a personal diary where we can store all the necessary info and call upon the item we need, using the more
               simplified and accurate tags. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </strong> <br>
        A function is a block of code we use to perform a certain task. They are useful because we can call on them when we need
         too without having to rewrite the code. We declare a function first by giving it a name, then we pass in an argument which
          could have any name, we then give the function an action which could be many things like a return or console.log.
           The final step is to call the function and pass in an object the function will use.
