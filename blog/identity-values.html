  <p >I was born and raised on the East Coast of Ngati Porou with all my learnings being in te reo Maori.  We grew up learning everything from our Nannies and Papa’s, from waiata (songs) to whakapapa (history), tikanga (traditions) and korero (stories) of both past and present. Our stories tell of great Rangatira and their journeys from Hawaiki to Aotearoa. Along with all the learnings came many beautiful values in life, such as carrying for your whanau and aroha for everyone you cross paths with. A major decision I had to make as a young man was leaving the Tairawhiti to further my knowledge and hoped to gain work doing something I loved, however I wasn’t able to complete my degree and spent the last 6 years working to pay off a student loan. Leaving home was a major decision for me and I have lived in many different towns since, although I pop home for the occasional holiday, I believe the decision for me to leave meant I would slowly start losing the connection with the people and the land. While I was growing up, I was told by many kuia (nannies) that I was a lovely, quite young man and at the time I thought that’s what all kuia said but as I got older I started to understand that that was a true gift handed down from our Tipuna (ancestors). The opportunity to study at Dev Academy in Gisborne is very special to me because not only am I close to home, I can also work and hopefully join the IT industry locally and eventually end up back in Paradise doing something I enjoy and helping the next generation.   </p>
 
<p> It has been a long time since I have worked with computers and I am still trying to get my head around it all. One of my strengths is definitely always wanting to learn more, however I am still very limited in English and finding it rather difficult with some of the terms being used in this course. The fact I have an Iwi behind me is very much encouraging and always on my mind when trying to push through the difficult times. I have a loving partner who I know will help when things get really tricky and whanau support is always there, with that in mind I do believe I will get through this course and go on to greater achievements. There have been many times when I have had issues working with others, some worked out fine and others not so much. One thing I always try to communicate is that there is a thousand different ways to finish a job and not one person is right, however if we were to work as a group and share ideas, we could all come to an answer we agree on. Although this had been my attitude towards many challenges in life, coding may be the turning point is terms of having the correct code to function properly, but when it comes to ideas and brainstorming then the technique of communicating and working as a group would work best </p>
