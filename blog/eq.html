  <p><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence? </strong><br>Emotional intelligence is something we are losing in today's modern world,
     it’s the emotions that are a hidden due to modern day stress and expectancies. Self-awareness and the ability to listen
      to others with patience are great practices of emotional intelligence. I believe Maori culture is a good example of 
      expressing and engaging with self-emotions and using culture as a good guide to behavior. There is hui (meetings) where
       ideas are passed around the room until everyone agrees. There is kapahaka where emotions are expressed through waiata-a-ringa,
        a time for being happy and expressive, moteatea-a time for sadness and grievance, and the haka- a time to let out the anger
         and frustration, all of which displayed for everyone to see and feel. And then celebrated by a cup of tea with more korero 
         about each other's well-being. I believe it is this structure that acts as a great guidance for your own behavior and emotions 
         and awareness for others how they are feeling, and by this we create a happy mind frame with room for exceedance.   </p> 
  <p><strong>How is it different to IQ? </strong> <br>EQ is self-awareness and detail to what others are feeling, where-as IQ is intelligence 
    without factoring in emotional response. Intelligence is what got us here today and without it we wouldn’t have achieved what we have today,
     but someone could have a high IQ and lack of EQ which ultimately will show in their work and leadership skills.   </p>
     <p><strong>Why is it important?  </strong><br>It is very important to keep in mind the true values of EQ if we want to live a balanced
         life-style and be great leaders. A lack in EQ means we are unaware of what other people, weather they are your workers or peers are 
         feeling, which results in a buildup of uncertainty and lack of confidence. Listening to others and also yourself creates a happy 
         mind frame and confidence to deliver full potential. It will help with happiness and stress and is very sought after in work
          environments in all industries. </p>
