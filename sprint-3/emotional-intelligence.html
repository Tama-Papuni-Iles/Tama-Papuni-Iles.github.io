<p><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong> <br> </p>
<p>Emotional intelligence is something we are losing in today's modern world,
     itâ€™s the emotions that are a hidden due to modern day stress and
      expectancies. Self-awareness and the ability to listen to others with 
      patience are great practices of emotional intelligence. I believe Maori
       culture is a good example of expressing and engaging with self-emotions 
       and using culture as a good guide to behavior. There is hui (meetings)
        where ideas are passed around the room until everyone agrees. There is
         kapahaka where emotions are expressed through waiata-a-ringa, a time for
          being happy and expressive, moteatea-a time for sadness and grievance,
             and the haka- a time to let out the anger and frustration, all of 
             which displayed for everyone to see and feel. And then celebrated by 
             a cup of tea with more korero about each other's well-being. 
             I believe it is this structure that acts as a great guidance for 
             your own behavior and emotions and awareness for others how they are 
             feeling, and by this we create a happy mind frame with room for exceedance. </p>
