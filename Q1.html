  <h1 class="values">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h1>
  <div class="main">
  <p>There are many elements used to create a webpage and some of them will have the same css 
      styles applied, however there are also elements that would have tailored styles added to them.
       Class is great way to apply style to multiple elements that will all look the same, for example you
        may have a Nav bar or headers which you would want to remain the same style for each of your html 
        pages. By creating a class and giving the nav bar on every page the same .class you can make 
        changes to all html pages containing the nav bar simply by editing the .class in you css stylesheet. 
        The order of which the classes are stored in you css file determines which style is applied to the element. 
        The lower class will always overwrite the all classes above it. 
      <img id ="image1" src="images/Screenshot class-1.jpg"> <img id="image2" src="images/Screenshot class-2.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      The id attribute on the other hand works really well when you want to apply style to a particular element without 
      affecting other elements around it. This is used when you may have something in a class but want to give a specific element of 
      that class its own style, you then create a #id attribute and cat edit with-out changing anything in that class. Id is more specific
       and should only be used once on a page where as a class is used on multiple pages. The #id attribute will overwrite any .class 
       attributes.
